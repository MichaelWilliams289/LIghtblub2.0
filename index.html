  I'm a 14-year-old aspiring Software Engineer with a deep passion for gaming. Currently, my favorite video game is Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, and I'm fully immersed in its challenges, constantly striving to overcome them. This game has inspired me so much that I've begun developing a Stalker mod. Although I'm still refining the concept, I'm thrilled about the creative journey and the potential to create something truly captivating. My ultimate dream is to become a game developer, and this project marks a significant step towards achieving that goal.
